%% must be 70-150 words to meet LNCS guidelines

What others have done that we build on: correctness checks, code
coverage, use of various testing styles (unit, functional, mutation)

Infrastructure novelty: Cloud-based autograding is scalable,
sandboxable, persistent, trustworthy.  Our cloud-based producer-consumer
autograder architecture allows custom autograders to be plugged in
easily, even for non-CS courses.  Compatible with edX and open source,
but uses simple RESTful APIs.

Grading novelty: Taking advantage of dynamic language features to
facilitate more thorough inspection of internal code (white box tests)

Experience: successful use of three distinct autograding strategies in
successive offerings of a MOOC.  Over XXX thousand assignments have been
graded using Amazon EC2.

Available to other instructors via SPOC; we run them as a service.
