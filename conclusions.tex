\section{Conclusions}

The autograders used by ESaaS have been running for nearly three years
and have graded hundreds of thousands of student assignments in our EdX
MOOC, our campus Software Engineering course, and many other
instructors' campus courses that use some or all of our materials.
Instructors interested in adopting them for their course, or in
creating adapters to connect them to other LMSs, are invited to
email \texttt{spoc@saasbook.info}.
