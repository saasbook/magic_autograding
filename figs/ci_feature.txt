Feature: Testing instructor created homeworks
  As a AutoGrader maintainer
  In order to check that the supplied homework can be graded
  I would like these homeworks to be automatically tested
  
  Scenario Outline: Runs AutoGrader with a given spec and subject
    Given I have the homework in "."
    When I run AutoGrader for <test_subject> and <spec>
    Then I should see that the results are <expected>
    And I should see the execution results with <test_title>
  Examples:
    | test_title  | test_subject         | spec        | expected     |
    | vs solution | solutions/hw4.tar.gz | rag/hw4.yml | Score: 100.0 |
    | vs skeleton | public/hw4.tar.gz    | rag/hw4.yml | Score: 0.0   |
