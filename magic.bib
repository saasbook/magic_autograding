   Abstract = {This paper describes our experience in trying to transfer our re-vised software engineering curriculum from UC Berkeley to other universities. We were in the first wave of Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs), and this paper lists the lessons learned about educational technology transfer from developing MOOCs. To make it easier for instructors to use MOOC material, EdX offers Small Private Online Course (SPOCs), a term that we coined.}
