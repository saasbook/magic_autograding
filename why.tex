\section{Why Another Autograder?}



a.	17 autograding systems and over 60  papers  about them, in 2006-2010 alone [survey]. why develop our own? 

b.	many existing systems not readily availbale and/or tightly integrated to some LMS. we were using Coursera and later OpenEdX

c.	good Ruby tools => thought we could do better than for other languages

d.	cloud scale => new in 2011. cite enrollment #s from early courses.

e.	need for security/isolation from LMS

f.	for reasons of managing large cohorts of students w/diverse HW/SW, solutions that require extensive install/config on student machine (Mailing It In [cite], download & deploy grader yourself, etc) were rejected. Needed to be zero-config.

g.	we believe another challenge to adoption is hassle for teacher to deploy. We believe SaaS-based hosted LMSs like OpenEdX will help. We're running our autograder as a service with OpenEdX as a submission front-end, and welcome others to use it.
